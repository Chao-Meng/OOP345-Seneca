The STL used in this workshop includes container and algorithm, specifically vector, list, sort, query sucha as for_each(), find_of(), copy_if(), count_if(). Using the latter methods avoids using manual loopsã€‚

This method of manually looping the code is highly readable and it is easy to understand the code.
The advantages of STL are reusability, high performance, high portability, and cross-platform.

void CovidCollection::sort(const char* parameter) {}, in this function, I will design to throw an error if there is input parameter is invalid.
